## `reftree` demo

### [Unzipping Immutability](immutability.md)

This talk takes advantage of `reftree` to observe several immutable data structures in action
and uncover their inner beauty. Having surfaced immutability’s crucial tricks,
we move our focus to lenses and zippers — handy tools that combine
the convenience of the “mutable world” with the expressiveness of functional programming.

### [Visualize your data structures!](visualize.md)

The above talk focused on immutable data and various ways it can be manipulated.

This time I would like to take you on a journey deep inside `reftree` itself,
so that we can see how some of these techniques and concepts can be applied...
to produce visualizations of themselves — using one of my favorite `reftree`
features: animations.
